Data Collection
>Used Python & API endpoint to scrape 300 out of 454 pages of property listings.
>Data saved into CSV format for further analysis.

Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
>Handled missing prices (marked as "Price not communicated")
>Converted price column to numeric (KES) and created price_m (millions)
>Removed duplicates & standardized location and property type fields

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
>Supply distribution by county & property category
>Price per square meter by county
>Bedroom count distribution
>Top 10 most expensive & least expensive properties

Visualization in Power BI Dashboard includes:
>KPIs: Total properties, average price, median price
>Top 10 expensive & least expensive properties
>Count of properties by bedrooms
